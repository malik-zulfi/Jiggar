# Proposed UX Improvements for Jiggar

Here is a list of suggested improvements to enhance the user experience of the Jiggar application.

### 1. Dashboard Empty States

*   **Observation:** The dashboard displays simple text like "No data to display" when there's no information.
*   **Suggestion:** Enhance the empty states with more engaging content. Instead of just text, consider adding relevant icons or illustrations and a clear call-to-action button. For example, "No positions assessed yet. Upload a Job Description to get started!" This will guide new users and make the application feel more polished.

### 2. More Informative OCR Progress

*   **Observation:** The file uploader shows a generic "Performing OCR..." message, which can feel slow for large documents.
*   **Suggestion:** Provide more granular feedback during OCR. Displaying progress like "Processing page 3 of 10..." gives the user a better sense of progress and reduces perceived waiting time.

### 3. Prominent Visual Cues for Edited JD Requirements

*   **Observation:** Edited requirements in the JD Analysis view are marked with a subtle ring.
*   **Suggestion:** Make the visual cue for edited requirements more prominent. In addition to the ring, consider a slightly different background color for the edited item. This will help users quickly identify their modifications.

### 4. "Re-assess" Button for Stale Candidate Assessments

*   **Observation:** The "Stale" indicator on a candidate card is a great feature, but it requires a manual re-assessment.
*   **Suggestion:** Add a "Re-assess" button next to the "Stale" indicator. This would allow recruiters to trigger an immediate re-assessment for that candidate against the updated JD, saving time and effort.

### 5. Proactive Chatbot Suggestions

*   **Observation:** The chatbot currently waits for user input.
*   **Suggestion:** Make the chatbot more proactive by offering suggested questions or actions when it's opened. Buttons like "Show top 5 candidates for..." or "Compare candidates for..." can guide the user and showcase the chatbot's capabilities.

### 6. Expanded Use of Loading Skeletons

*   **Observation:** While you use loading indicators, some UI elements can appear abruptly as data loads.
*   **Suggestion:** Implement skeleton loaders more broadly across the application. Using placeholder previews for components like the candidate cards and analysis sections will create a smoother and more professional loading experience.
