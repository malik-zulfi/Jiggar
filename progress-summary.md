# Progress on HR_Jiggar Project Improvement Plan

This document summarizes the progress made on the HR_Jiggar Project Improvement Plan as of August 17, 2025.

## **Phase 0: Foundational Setup (Quick Wins)** - **COMPLETED** âœ…

### **1. Developer Experience** ðŸ”µ LOW EFFORT / HIGH IMPACT

- **Add Prettier for consistent formatting:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Installed `prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier`.
  - Created `.prettierrc.json` and `.prettierignore`.
  - Integrated Prettier with ESLint in `.eslintrc.json`.
  - Formatted the entire project.
- **Implement Husky for pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting):** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Installed `husky`.
  - Initialized Husky and created a `pre-commit` hook to run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npx prettier --write .`.
- **Add commit message linting (commitlint):** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Installed `@commitlint/cli` and `@commitlint/config-conventional`.
  - Created `commitlint.config.js`.
  - Created a `commit-msg` Husky hook to run `commitlint`.
- **Set up VS Code workspace settings for consistency:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Updated `.vscode/settings.json` to enable format on save, set Prettier as default formatter, and enable ESLint validation.
- **New: Add `.env.local` for environment variables (API keys):** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Created `.env.example` and an empty `.env.local`.
  - Updated `.gitignore` to ignore all `.env` files except `.env.example`.

## **Phase 1: Critical Fixes & Stability (Week 1-2)**

### **2. API Routes & Error Handling** âœ… HIGH PRIORITY

- **Create `src/app/api/genkit/cv-analyzer/route.ts`:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Created the API route and implemented the `POST` handler.
  - Integrated with `analyzeCVAgainstJD` Genkit flow.
  - Implemented robust error handling and request/response validation.
- **Create `src/app/api/genkit/jd-analyzer/route.ts`:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Created the API route and implemented the `POST` handler.
  - Integrated with `extractJDCriteria` Genkit flow.
  - Implemented robust error handling and request/response validation.
- **Create `src/app/api/genkit/candidate-summarizer/route.ts`:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Created the API route and implemented the `POST` handler.
  - Integrated with `summarizeCandidateAssessments` Genkit flow.
  - Implemented robust error handling and request/response validation.
- **Create `src/app/api/genkit/findSuitablePositions/route.ts`:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Created the API route and implemented the `POST` handler.
  - Integrated with `findSuitablePositionsForCandidate` Genkit flow.
  - Implemented robust error handling and request/response validation.
- **Implement robust error handling and request/response validation in each new route:** **COMPLETED** âœ… (Addressed during route creation)
- **Add React Error Boundaries for major UI sections:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Created a generic `ErrorBoundary` component (`src/components/error-boundary.tsx`).
  - Wrapped the main `layout.tsx` with the `ErrorBoundary`.
  - Added `"use client";` directive to `ErrorBoundary` to ensure it runs client-side.
- **Implement a global error handler component/toast system for user feedback:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Created `src/lib/error-handler.ts` with a `handleError` function that uses `useToast`.
  - Created `src/lib/api-client.ts` to centralize API calls and integrate `handleError`.
- **Ensure all AI calls consistently use the `withRetry` utility:** **COMPLETED** âœ… (Confirmed during API route implementation)

### **3. Data Security & Privacy** âœ… HIGH PRIORITY

- **Investigate and implement a secure client-side storage solution:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Installed `crypto-js` and its types.
  - Created `src/lib/secure-storage.ts` for encrypted `localStorage` operations.
  - Refactored `src/components/client-provider.tsx` to use `secure-storage.ts`.
  - **Troubleshooting Note:** Encountered and addressed "Malformed UTF-8 data" and "Unexpected end of JSON input" errors by making `secureGetItem` more robust and advising `localStorage` clear.
- **Sanitize all file uploads before processing:** **COMPLETED** âœ…
  - Created `src/app/api/sanitize-file/route.ts` for server-side file sanitization.
  - Moved PDF/DOCX parsing logic to this new API route.
  - Refactored `src/components/file-uploader.tsx` to call the new API route.
  - Removed `src/lib/file-sanitizer.ts`.
  - **Detailed Troubleshooting for PDF Parsing:**
    - Initially switched from `pdf-parse` to `pdfjs-dist` to resolve "Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'" and `ReferenceError: DOMMatrix is not defined` errors, configuring `pdfjs-dist` with its `legacy` build for server-side.
    - Encountered "Module not found: Can't resolve 'pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.worker.min.js'" when `pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc` was set, which was then removed.
    - Experienced file truncation issues in `route.ts` due to an incorrect `replace` operation, which was subsequently fixed by rewriting the file content.
    - Re-encountered `ReferenceError: DOMMatrix is not defined` when attempting to use the non-`legacy` build of `pdfjs-dist`.
    - Switched back to `pdf-parse`, but faced `ENOENT: no such file or directory` errors, as `pdf-parse` attempted to access internal test files during import in the Next.js server environment.
    - Attempted `pdf-to-text`, but it lacked direct buffer support and its API was not suitable for the current implementation.
    - **Final Solution:** Implemented PDF text extraction using the `pdftotext` command-line utility via Node.js's `child_process.exec`. This approach bypasses Node.js library bundling complexities.
    - **Crucial Fix for Windows:** Adjusted temporary file paths from `/tmp/` to use `os.tmpdir()` to ensure cross-platform compatibility and resolve `ENOENT` errors on Windows.
    - **Note:** This solution requires `pdftotext` to be installed and available in the system's PATH on the deployment server.
