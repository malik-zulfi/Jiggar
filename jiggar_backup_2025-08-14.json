He demonstrates strong alignment with most technical skills, soft skills, and responsibilities, having led numerous master planning and architectural projects across diverse international locations, including the Middle East. His leadership roles as Principal and Founder highlight his capability in project management, team leadership, and stakeholder communication. The primary area of misalignment is his educational background, which does not precisely match the required Bachelor's in Architecture and Master's in Urban Design. Additionally, while he has related experience, specific examples of designing cityscapes in industrial cities are limited, and Arabic language knowledge is not mentioned.",
